An heir who violates the laws of a house is made an excoriate: stripped of the house name and forbidden from drawing on house resources. An excoriate must surrender their signet ring, any other property that can be claimed as a gift of the house, and the name of both house and family. Their likeness is circulated through the major enclaves of the house. Heirs of their house are forbidden to provide them with aid or succour, and the other houses typically shun excoriates of any line.

            "description": "<p><em>Dhakaani bugbears are known as Guul\u2019dar, \u201cstrong folk,\u201d and are celebrated for their strength and courage. Though they appear slow, they are capable of great bursts of strength or speed when necessary. Many yearn to prove their mettle on the battlefield, risking their lives to earn the glory known as atcha. Others instead find themselves at peace in small isolated clans, moving in flow with the nature around them.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Bugbears, for many, are monsters belonging to storybooks and nightmares. Stories speak of bugbears as great hairy beasts that lurk in the shadows - it is the bugbears that lie in the darkness undetected, waiting for the children that strayed off the beaten path or too far from their parents, or for the villagers wandering out at night away from their homes. They drag the foolish and unsuspecting to their den to be devoured alive; worse, if they cut off your head, your soul is bound to Eberron and can never reach Dolurrh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>These terrible and fearsome stories flowered from small seeds of truth. Most bugbears, despite their size, rely on stealth and the cover of night to surprise their enemies - expending great bursts of energy to end fights before the victim can react. However, bugbears themselves are no more likely to eat other humanoids than humans themselves. The true bugbears of the forest, unlike those expected from human folklore, tend towards peace and the flow of nature rather than violence. After the Last War, many more stories of stoic bugbear rangers or druids guiding lost troops to safety through impossible terrain have been retold by soldiers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alongside this, new stories of bugbears are being forged by Darguun, a nation that rose from the ashes of the Last War. There are also many stories yet untold of the militant bugbears belonging to the secretive Dhakaani Empire.\u00a0</p>\n<h2>You might...</h2>\n<p>- Present an air of indolence that hides the vicious ferocity you display in battle.</p>\n<p>- Use your great strength, long limbs, and endurance to perform feats of athletics that few others are capable of.</p>\n<p>- Move slowly and in time with the world around you, listening and waiting until the time is right to expend your energy.</p>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<p>- Walk and talk cautiously around you, in fear of invoking your ire.</p>\n<p>- Look to use your might to their advantage, assuming that you are easily outsmarted.</p>\n<p>- Underestimate your silent step - assuming that your great mass could not possibly move as quietly as the stories say.</p>\n<h2>Physical Description...</h2>\n<p>These stealthy and strong goblinoid creatures can thrive in the mayhem of battle or move slowly with the world around them - regardless they usually conserve their great reserves of energy until needed. Standing between 6 to 8 feet tall and weighing 250 to 300lbs, bugbears outsize most humanoids that they meet. Bugbears are typically extremely muscular, able to lift and move great weights with their long limbs. They are covered in thick short yellowish fur and share the same pointed ears as their goblinoid cousins. Due to their longer limbs, weapons wielded in the hands of bugbears have a greater reach than typical.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite their great size, bugbears show an uncanny ability to sneak up on the unsuspecting. They can use their quiet step and darkvision to move quietly through the night, unnoticed if they so desire.</p>\n<p>Bugbears reach physical adulthood around the age of 16, and they can live up to 80 years. For those that strive for glory in battle or perform dangerous manual labour, death by old age is far less common.\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Society...</h2>\n<p>Of the communities bugbears can belong to, the ones that are primarily goblinoid are Dhakaan, Darguun, or the isolated druidic communities found throughout Khorvaire but primarily in the Khraal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dhakaani society is bound by the philosophy of mu'ut and atcha, both respectively meaning the duty to one's empire and personal honour[46]. The martial culture and rigid caste system of Dhakaan places bugbears in roles of aiding with demanding physical labour and being amongst the strongest warriors.\u00a0</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<p>See Exploring Eberron (p. 96) for more information on Dhakaani Society.</p>\n</section>\n<p>Darguun, on the other hand, is a nation carved out of Cyre by goblinoid mercenaries during the Last War. While bugbears found in this region are likely to still place importance on their physical might and rely on their innate strength, they do not have the same venerance of mu'ut and atcha that characterizes the Dhakaani within their culture.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Acting as a counterpart to both regions, the druidic bugbears find an alternative path of life, not abandoning their strengths and stealth, but rather using them to meld into the nature surrounding them. These communities of bugbears are smaller and less centralized. Often druids, rangers, or wisdom's guide these communities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, bugbears can also be found integrated within human settlements, and needn't originate from strictly goblinoid communities. These bugbears often take up the culture of the nations they are found in and can play a diversity of roles within them.\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion...</h2>\n<p>The religion of an individual bugbear depends on the culture in which they were raised. Bugbears of the Dhakaani Empire do not subscribe to a set religion but share the same spiritual connection to Uul Dhakaan, a dreamlike nation that guides the Empire. Alongside this, Dhakaani venerate historical conquests, their previous leaders and warriors, and their past through story-telling. Instead of clerics, their spirituality is guided by the bardic dirge-singers who commemorate the tales of old and those to come.</p>\n<p>The druidic cultures of the forest-dwelling bugbears are similar to their Dhakaani kin, wherein there is a higher prevalence of ancestor worship, bardic spiritual leaders, although there is less glorification of military feats in their stories.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is no unifying religion for the bugbears within Darguun, and the bugbears found in human communities are more likely to subscribe to the populous' religious beliefs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All bugbears, especially for those of the Dhakaani Empire, lean towards lawful alignments. This can manifest in a tendency towards organization, whether this is found in centralized or decentralized communities.\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Names...</h2>\n<p>Goblinoid names often feature drawn-out vowel sounds (represented by doubled letters), as seen in the names of both their ancient empire (Dhakaan) and their newborn country (Darguun). Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears use the same names and naming conventions, despite their tribal differences.

They have memories of lives never lived, visions of combat with fiends that they never fought, and the sense of an endless struggle against darkness. For all the pain and suffering in the world, the Kalashtar know that there is a path to light. Some faceless enemies would hunt all the Kalashtar down and would see their bloodlines eradicated. The Kalashtar's path to light is a dangerous one, as death awaits in the shadows. </em></p>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"content w-100\">\u00a0</div>\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<p>The Kalashtar, throughout Khorvaire, are viewed as deeply spiritual people with an other-worldly quality that is hard for many to place. This alien nature is a result of what the Kalashtar are; creatures born from the willing union between humans and quori spirits from the Plane of Dreams, Dal Quor. These Quori spirits are born of the periodic cycles of Dal Quor - which alternate between Light and Dark. As each cycle comes to an end, it is destroyed and reborn as the other. The current phase of Dal Quor is darkness, it is that of il-Lashtavar - also known as the Dreaming Dark. The quori of the Dreaming Dark rule Dal Quor and aim to extend their cycle forever and block out the light to come. However, centuries ago, a handful of quori spirits rejected these machinations and fled from Dal Quor.<br />Sixty-seven of these rebel spirits escaped into Eberron and found sanctuary in the minds and bodies of Sarlonan monks. These monks are the ancestors of the modern-day Kalashtar. The quori spirits live through the bloodlines of their first hosts, inherited through generations. By maintaining these bloodlines, the mere existence of the Kalashtar is a protest to the evil of the Dreaming Dark and its goals. However, the Dreaming Dark seeks to extinguish these rebel spirits. If they succeed, and a bloodline is terminated, it means the loss of the spirit, and its return into Dal Quor to be reborn and moulded to the Dreaming Dark. <br />While most kalashtar quori are one of the original sixty-seven escaped spirits, it is possible for a Kalashtar to join with a Quori spirit who recently abandoned the Dreaming Dark.<br />As a result of their bonds to their Quori spirit, Kalashtar experience the world differently than other creatures. Their bonded nature enables an aptitude for psionics and greater resistance against psionic attacks. Not only this, but the Kalashtar have an ability to greater influence the emotional domain</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<p>of their once fiendish quori. The quori represent concepts of nightmares - pride, rage, aggression, deceit - and these concepts were once the source of their power, before turning away from the Dreaming Dark. Now embedded into a Kalashtar, the quori provide their host with a greater understanding of what these emotions are. Coupled with their psionics, Kalashtar can influence the emotional states of their enemies, allies, or even themselves, temporarily. While aptitude in using these skills might vary between Kalashtar, all have the ability to develop and grow their powers through rigorous training and meditation.<br />Though the Kalashtar are bonded with their Quori, they cannot speak to their quori directly \u2013 instead, the relationship is experienced as a sense of inspiration and instinct. Some Kalashtar experience the presence of their quori in the way they feel some emotions more intensely than others; other Kalashtar find they can inspire those around them to feel or fight back against fear, cruelty, or malice.<br />One of the unique results of the quori flight from Dal Quor is that both the Kalashtar and their Quori spirit are unable to return to Dal Quor when they sleep. Instead, Kalashtar experience a trance state shared with their Quori. This trance enables them to relive moments belonging to the ancestors of their Kalashtar line, and even the memories of their quori before it bonded. The adage of the wise Kalashtar often comes from the fact that in their singular life they hold the experiences of many more.<br />Throughout the centuries, the machinations of the Dreaming Dark have not yielded, and the evil spirits of Dal Quor still aim to dampen the coming of the Light. For this reason, agents of the Dreaming Dark exist in Khorvaire to eradicate the lineages housing the escaped quori. On the continent of Sarlonna, the Dreaming Dark has taken hostage humans and pose</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"bg-paper page d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"page-overlay\">\u00a0</div>\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<p>as Inspired, spiritual guides that now lead the Riedran nation. Not all Kalashtar characters are aware of the Dreaming Dark and its connection to Sarlona, but the Dreaming Dark hunts for them all the same.</p>\n<h2>You might\u2026</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Aim to understand the emotions of those around you, even if the situation doesn't call for it.</li>\n<li>Very rarely consider the limitations you may encounter as you draw up your goals and aspirations.</li>\n<li>Believe that the rules of reality can be bent like those in dreams.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably\u2026</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Think you're human, though you move and act in a slightly otherworldly way.</li>\n<li>Find themselves drawn to the wisdom you display, which seems beyond your years.</li>\n<li>Opening their emotions to you, even before they realize they are doing so.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description\u2026</h2>\n<p>Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions. Beyond this, most creatures struggle to tell Kalshtar and Humans apart at a glance. [52]</p>\n<h2>Society\u2026</h2>\n<p>There are three main kalashtar societies.<br />The Adaran Kalashtar live lives most similar to the first monks that opened their arms to the refugee quori spirits. They still live on the continent Sarlona, but belong to the land of Adar. The Empire of Riedra, ruled by agents of the Dreaming Dark, currently dominates Sarlona, and imperial forces endlessly siege Adar. The monks and priests of Adar believe that the war against the Inspired and the Dreaming Dark won\u2019t be won with weapons; instead, prayer and guided meditation will ultimately shift the balance from darkness to light. They believe the Age of Light will come to Dal Quor, and through their passive actions, they sustain their quori and protect it from returning to the Dreaming Dark. Adaran kalashtar rarely take direct action without reason. They are also ascetic, disciplined, and focused on the Path of Light. They are taught to inspire those who live in fear and enlighten those lost to darkness.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<p>The Khorvairian kalashtar exist in communities of several major cities of the Five Nations, including the Overlook district in Sharn and Whitewalls in Fairhaven. They prefer to stay close to one another, both to practice their shared traditions and to stand together against any threats posed by the Dreaming Dark. They are familiar with the Path of Light and other kalashtar customs, but there\u2019s no Riedran army at the gates; they know the Dreaming Dark is a threat, but it\u2019s a ghost in the shadows. These kalashtar believe that the Age of Light will be supported through their daily actions, such as showing kindness and compassion or mediating disputes. <br />On the other hand, some of the kalashtar of Khorvaire have embraced a grim path in the battle against darkness. The Shadow Watchers don\u2019t believe that evil can be fought merely with kindness and prayer. Members of this order seek to identify sources of corruption and ruthlessly eliminate them. They believe the Age of Light will come when the Darkness is defeated. As such, a Shadow Watcher\u2019s focus is typically on agents of the Dreaming Dark, although they can pursue any force of evil, supernatural or otherwise.<br />However, your kalashtar might not belong to a community with others of their kind at all. An orphaned kalashtar without spiritual guidance might not be able to understand their trances, the way their quori influences their emotions or the manifestations of their psionic abilities. If your Kalashtar does not know fully what they are, what is their relationship with their unique abilities? [53]</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion\u2026</h2>\n<p>All quori spirits that inhabit the Kalashtar were born of the Dreaming Dark \u2013\u00a0they represent nightmare qualities, those of rage, deceit, and pride. However, this does not lend Kalashtar to fall easily into evil alignments. These connections can instead result in Kalashtar gaining a greater sense of empathy: understanding the pains of fear, the hubris of pride, and the folly of deceit.<br />Kalashar, just like the humans they originated from, can have an evil alignment. However, those raised with an understanding of their quori tend to develop positive relationships with the darkness their spirit may represent. However lofty their goals are, they will achieve their motivations in any number of ways, so neither law nor chaos has strong sway over the kalashtar. Most kalashtar are devoted to the Path of Light, and</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page-overlay\">\u00a0</div>\n<div class=\"right d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<h2>Link minds</h2>\n<p>You gain the link mind cantrip as an innate occult spell that you can cast at will.

While shifters cannot completely change like werecreatures, they can shift to take on the features of their beast within. From their beast within a shifter gains extraordinary abilities, such as deadly fangs, refined senses, speed, and other similar traits.</em></p>\n<p>Shifters are a diverse ancestry that combines the traits of humanoid and beast heritage, not unlike a were-creature. At a young age, each shifter discovers their beast within, which comes to define who they are as a person. With the ability to draw on their inherent beast to temporarily shift into a more animalistic version of themselves, they are sometimes also referred to as the were-touched. While some believe shifters are the descendants of werecreatures, the opposite is true. The first werecreatures to plague Khorvaire are said to be shifters who were cursed with great evil. Shifters are unrelated to modern werecreatures and are a distinct ancestry of Eberron with unique cultures and traditions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite the distinction between shifters and werecreatures, shifters were persecuted during the fifty-year crusade against werecreatures less than two centuries ago. Targeted by the crusaders who fought against the rising lycanthrope tide, many innocent shifters were killed in the crusade to eliminate the threat. Since then, most shifters across Khorvaire prefer to live in enclaves or districts of other shifters - avoiding other ancestries which may still bear them ill will.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>You might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Prefer the companionship of other shifters or a close group of friends.</li>\n<li>Feel strong emotions, typically manifesting in the spirit of your beast within.</li>\n<li>View survival as a challenge, and strive to be self-reliant, adaptable, and resourceful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Others Probably...\u00a0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume that you have a natural connection to animals and the natural world.

While travelling, shifters tend to move in springs and leaps rather than simply walking alongside their humanoid companions. Their faces and bodies typically show traits of their beast within, such as longer fangs, pointed ears, feline eyes, and other such features. Their bodies -especially their legs and forearms -are typically covered in more hair than a human, creating a fur-like covering over their limbs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A shifter's stance is typically upright with their weight placed on only the front of their clawed feet, creating a semi-digitigrade look.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A Shifters' beast within is more obvious when they are transformed into their hybrid shape, their features shifting to resemble the animal to which they are connected. The manifestation of these features varies from shifter to shifter, but typically, their teeth become more prominent, their skin toughens like hide, their hair lengthens, and their eyes reshape.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Society...\u00a0</h2>\n<p>Shifters are a relatively uncommon race in the Five Nations, there are more changelings in Breland than there are shifters. Yet, the shifters who live throughout Khorvaire have formed tight-knit communities. There are two primary types of shifter communities. The first type of community is a nomadic tribal hunter-gather pack, common in the remote woods of the Eldeen Reaches. The other is common in urban centres where shifters form small enclaves to hold on to their traditions and remain with those who understand their ways.</p>\n<p>The communities of the deep forests of the Eldeen Reaches are typically formed out of a desire to be free of the control of nations and other ancestries. These communities are frequently nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes and are primarily composed of shifters. While it is not unheard of to have other ancestries present in a tribe, shifters typically tend to prefer to bond with fellow shifters. Here the culture and traditions of the shifter communities are strongest, as the shifter community cooperates for the good of one another and the survival of the community.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shifter communities of the enclaves of major cities typically form as a result of shifters desire to hold on to their culture and traditions. As the minority in many of these urban regions, without these tight-knit groups shifters struggle to hold on to the culture and traditions of their upbringing.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>While the shifter parents are dedicated to raising their children, the family structure is different from many other ancestries. Shifter children typically form a strong bond with a few other children around their age group. Though the children in these groups are typically from many different families, this initial bond is often the strongest bond that a shifter forms in their life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion...\u00a0</h2>\n<p>Shifters are typically neutral and view the world as a struggle to survive. The moral and ethical concerns of a shifter are typically centred around the well-being of those directly around them. However, shifters are as varied in alignment as they are in the animals that they draw ancestry from, and can be inclined to any alignment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After the silver crusade, shifters have become suspicious of any outside religion. Having seen how religion can motivate people, they view intense or conflict-prone religions as terrifying forces capable of causing great harm. As a result, shifters' religions are typically varied and less intense than many would expect of their culture.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Many shifters follow some form of druidic worship. The most common druidic worship of shifters is that of the order of druids known as the moonspeakers. These moonspeakers draw meaning from the movements of the moons and believe that the moon's influence over their heritage gives the moons great power over shifters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other shifters who reside in the major cities of Khorvaire have taken up worship of the local religion. Many shifters in the urban centres of Khorvaire revere Balinor and Boldrei of the Sovereign Host, and many shifter adventurers revere the ways of the Traveller of the Dark Six.\u00a0</p>\n<p>During the silver purge, some shifters adopted the faith of the Silver Flame and participated in the crusade. There are still shifters active in the church of the silver flame, though to much scorn of other shifters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Names...\u00a0</h2>\n<p>Shifters typically take on names similar to that of humans, or that of the community around them though with a more rustic inclination. Shifters typically have a personal name that they use with their friends and a wandering name that they use with strangers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>Sample names\u00a0</strong></h3>\n<p>Aethelwulf, Bennin, Bree, Burch, Dominic, Erylis, Geth, Karmos, Lorelai, Lyndra, Taria, Volante\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>Sample wandering names\u00a0</strong></h3>\n<p>Ash, Aurora, Autumn, Brook, Claw, Cliff, Dawn, Flint, Frost, Hazel, Iris, Lily, Rain, River, Rose, Rock, Thorn, Torn, Storm, Summer\u00a0</p>",

            "description": "<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<p>Warforged were created as expendable construct soldiers to fight in the last war. Early Cannith development of the warforged war focused on the production of warforged such as the warforged titans which were true constructs - machines of war built to destroy, kill, and die on command. With further refinements and arcane experimentation, the warforged evolved until they were a new type of creature - a living construct. This advancement in development was made possible by the creation forges but came with the side-effect of adding sentience to the new construct known only as warforged. However, with their single-minded focus and combat prowess, sentience empowered warforged with a desire to preserve themselves than Cannith's other mindless constructs exhibit - making them a more efficient soldier than simple golems.</p>\n<p>In the wake of the Last War, the Treaty of Thronehold has granted warforged their rights and freedom from being used as bought-and-sold soldiers of nations. This newfound freedom for warforged is a double-edged sword, as many warforged struggle to find a place in a world that no longer cares for them. Some warforged have taken up new employments as labourers and artisans; many warforged have taken on employment doing what they already know and fight fiercely as a soldier. The warforged that fight on have taken roles as guards, mercenaries, adventurers, and some have found their way back into the employment of armies. Warforged in these roles make steadfast allies and fearsome enemies. They fight with a vigour that most humanoids struggle to match - but with the ability to adapt and learn that mindless constructs can not replicate.</p>\n<h2>You might\u2026</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have scars and wounds from fighting in the last war, dealing with old injuries and trauma that has never healed</li>\n<li>Often misread other creatures' emotions, struggling to understand their - and your own - feelings</li>\n<li>Apply wartime thinking to every situation, analyzing every situation as a tactical puzzle<br />\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably\u2026</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Believe you do not experience emotions and are incapable of higher thinking beyond your programming</li>\n<li>Are an expendable asset, and to be taken advantage of for your tireless nature and lack of world experience outside the war</li>\n<li>See you as a valuable ally to have on the battlefield, even if sometimes they struggle to relate to you</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div class=\"bg-paper page d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<h2>Physical Description\u2026</h2>\n<p>Warforged appear to be a completely constructed creature. Their frame is composed of a composite of materials\u2014obsidian, iron, stone, darkwood, silver, and organic material. Around a warforged's frame is a musculature is composed of root-like cords infused with alchemical liquids that grant strength and surprising grace and flexibility to their body. Their exterior is covered in a series of flexible metallic or leather plates, creating a form of integrated armour which grants them protection on the battlefield. This integrated armour is attached directly into their body by the root-like tendrils of their musculature and is extremely painful to remove. Most warforged share a similar facial structure, with a hinged jaw and crystal eys embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. The specific composition and structure of each warforged changes depending on their intended purpose, but all warforged are humanoid in shape. <br />Unique among constructs, warforged have learned to modify their bodies through magic and training. These unique changes that warforged choose helps define their personality and differentiate their physical form from one warforged from another.</p>\n<p>As constructs, warforged typically don't need to breathe, eat, or sleep; however, the body of a warforged needs to vent alchemical impurities at a constant rate. This venting process requires breathable air to prevent a buildup of impurities in a warforged's alchemical fluids which can seize a warforged's biological components, sometimes to fatal effect. Thus, warforged can still suffocate much like living creatures, but can in a limited sense hold their breath as other humanoid creatures can. Though they don't sleep, warforged require a period of restoration to allow the alchemical fluids of their body to replenish. Without this process, a warforged is incapable of fully restoring their body and they enter an inefficient state (similar to a humanoid who doesn't get 8 hours of sleep).</p>\n<p>Warforged were created by Cannith within the last 30 years, and as a result, their life expectancy is unknown. Older warforged have begun to show signs of physical decay, indicating that they may eventually degrade. Though it is still unclear (and Cannith has never provided a clear answer), it appears that warforged may have innate souls. A warforged's body is as vulnerable to destruction as any other creature's body is, and warforged that have been destroyed require magical intervention such as resurrection magic to restore themselves.</p>\n<p>As constructs, warforged have no concept of gender - nor is their body designed to a specific gendered shape. Though some warforged have selected a gender identity, most warforged are unaware or choose to ignore the concept altogether.</p>\n<h2>Society\u2026</h2>\n<p>Warforged were created as soldiers to fight in the last war, and have only gained their freedom within the last two years. As a result, warforged do not have any established cultures or traditions, or any sort of developed place in society. Most warforged have picked up the culture of the nation they fought for, and others have latched on to bits and pieces that interest them creating a mixed celebration of traditions. Since most warforged struggle to relate to other humanoids, most of the time they will band together with other warforged who provide a sense of familiarity. Sometimes this group is those they fought with in the last war, other times it is simply others like them who decided to settle in the local area.</p>\n<p>Sometimes warforged prefer to lead solitary lives or work to integrate themselves into other humanoid societies. Some warforged wander Khorvaire, looking to find purpose and meaning for themselves and have become ambassadors between cultures.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"bg-paper page d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"page-overlay\">\u00a0</div>\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<h2>Alignment and Religion\u2026</h2>\n<p>Warforged tend to be neutrally aligned. As constructs of war, they were built to fight without questioning orders - though they are capable of doing so. Warforged are capable of emotion and moral reasoning, however, this is something few were trained or practised in and most struggle to comprehend.</p>\n<p>Warforged similarly tend to be unreligious. As a soldier some warforged have picked up the religion of their humanoid companions, beginning the follow the Sovereign Host as a soldier of Cyre, or the Silver Flame as a Thranish soldier, but independently most have not been drawn to religion. Warforged that have begun to follow a religion have sometimes found an answer to the questions of their existence and their purpose in life, but these warforged are few between.</p>\n<p>Some warforged have begun to be drawn towards a messianic figure called the Lord of Blades. The Lord of Blades has begun to gather a cult-like following of warforged by promising purpose to the disaffected and a rebellion against the \"weak-fleshed\" ancestries.</p>\n<h2>Names\u2026</h2>\n<p>Most warforged do not have a name for themselves beyond their creation number such as unit 4859. Only after being able to experience the world outside of military structure have they begun to understand the need of other races to have names for everything. Many warforged accept any name that others give them, and warforged working in proximity to other humanoids are often are referred to by nicknames. Some warforged, however, have come to see having a name as a defining moment of their new existence, and thus search long and hard for the perfect name to attach to themselves.</p>\n<h3>Sample warforged names</h3>\n<p>Anchor, Banner, Bastion, Blade, Blue, Bow, Cart, Church, Crunch, Crystal, Dagger, Dent, Five, Glaive, Hammer, Iron, Lucky, Mace, Oak, Onyx, Pants, Pierce, Red, Rod, Rusty, Scout, Seven, Shield, Slash, Smith, Spike, Temple, Vault, Wall<br />\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Integrated Armor</h2>\n<p>Your heritage grants you one type of integrated armour, as noted below. If your integrated armour becomes destroyed, it no longer grants an item bonus to your AC but remains integrated into your body. However, your destroyed integrated armour can still be repaired at a very hard DC for its level, losing the destroyed condition when its HP is above 0.</p>\n<h3>Nominal Integrated Armour</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[pathfinders-guide-to-eberron.eberron-items.mZ363pCsYIZXbOIV]{Nominal Integrated Armour}</p>\n<p>Your body does not have the armour protections afforded to most other warforged.

In particular, their abilities allow them to take the form of other humanoid creatures with little limitation on who. Many use their gifts as a form of artistic expression or to convey their current emotional state, adopting certain personas depending on the context of their moods. However, it does not go unnoticed by many, including some changelings themselves, that their ability is an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and those whose aims are to deceive. This leads many people to treat changelings with general suspicion.<br />Changelings are born to one of three paths. A few are raised in stable communities where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Others are part of nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations, families who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins. Some clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander the unpredictable path of the god known as the Traveler. Wherever humans live, changelings reside also; the question is whether they make their presence known.<br />A persona is known as the faces and personalities each changeling chooses to adopt - based on where changelings are born their personas are likely to vary. A changeling born in an isolated community might only possess one persona that they developed, using a single face as they exist on Khorvaire, while those belonging to a community of changelings will have multiple personas and perhaps come to share them with one another, each being \"Tamirin the Traveling</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<p>Seamstress\" on different days of the week.</p>\n<h2>You might\u2026</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Shift your shape to a persona that matches your mood or current activity. Though you, never use a particular form for too long before moving on to the next.</li>\n<li>Travel light, and keep an eye on the road, never settling down - whether that be a fear of being driven away or simply a restless desire to travel.</li>\n<li>Take a great interest in the people around you, their stories, and their histories. After all, these new learnings might be the basis for one of your future personas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably\u2026</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Others assume that because you have the uncanny ability to change their faces at will, that you will use it for malevolent ends, cheating honest folk before moving on.</li>\n<li>Employ you for your ability to shift your shape to any number of forms, whether this is for entertainment, acting, or protection.</li>\n<li>Don't understand the fluid nature you have with gender, form, or personality.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description\u2026</h2>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Changelings are typically 5 to 6ft tall, weighing between 120 to 180lbs. Their base form is a nondescript humanoid shape with white skin, hair, and featureless eyes - not unlike a mannequin. Beyond this, because of their ability to shift-shape, changelings do not have a set physical description.</p>\n<h2>Society\u2026</h2>\n<p>Changeling society is fragmented, and no two groups of changelings have the same culture. However, for changelings that live in areas where other of their kind reside, and often shared feature is a fluidity in concepts of identity, gender, and personality. Changelings that aim to master the form of shapechanging and mimicry tend to treat each persona as a real being, breathing life into reach persona. Some almost eternal figures of local legend, like the vampires lurking in abandoned fortresses, are instead multi-generational efforts of changeling families, all inheriting the persona when they are deemed ready. Is your changeling adventuring to prove they are worthy of inheriting one of these legendary personas?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"bg-paper page d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<h2>Alignment and Religion\u2026</h2>\n<p>Changelings tend towards pragmatic neutrality, and few changelings embrace evil. As changelings are primarily products of the culture in which they grow, their moral alignment tends to match the alignment of their peers. Similarly, for religion, a changeling might be inclined to follow the dominant faith of their peers.</p>\n<p>However, many changelings find a connection to the Traveler and live a life with less consistency and more chaos - almost as if the god of trickery and change guides them.</p>\n<h2>Names\u2026</h2>\n<p>A changeling might use a different name for each mask and persona, and adopt new names as easily as they change faces. The true name of a changeling tends to be simple and monosyllabic. For changelings that share personas with their communities, there are often accents each individual changeling employs that is missed by the single-skins. Two changelings might both play the role of Amel, but one is Amel-with-vivid-blue-eyes and the other is Amel-with-golden-nails.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Changeling Names: Aunn, Bin, Cas, Dox, Fie, Hars, Jin, Lam, Mas, Nix, Ot, Paik, Ruz, Sim, Toox, Vil, Yug</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"note d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<h4 class=\"inline-header\"><br />See the Exploring Eberron entry on Changeling personas on pg. 34.<br /><br /></h4>\n<p>[48] Exploring Eberron.
